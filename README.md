# IEEE_TGRS_HyperSINet
HyperSINet: A Synergetic Interaction Network Combined With Convolution and Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification

Configuration
---
* Python 3.8.0

* PyTorch 1.7.0.

* i7-8700K CPU

* NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU

How to Use?
---

* Set up the dataset in the main. py file and change the data path in the data_deader file.

* If the data is too large to exceed the GPU's capacity, the size of the superpixel can be changed, that is, "scale=?".

* Python main. py.
